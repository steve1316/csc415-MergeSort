## Notes: Since this project is designed to handle generic data types, the project is using an array of Integer objects to 
##        demonstration purposes. There is another array commented out containing String objects if you want to test Strings.
##        Otherwise, remove them and test your own array of data types of your choosing. Adjust name of your array accordingly.
